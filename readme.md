Scan your HTTPS-enabled website for Mixed Content

Built by Bramus! ([https://www.bram.us/](https://www.bram.us/)) and [Contributors](https://github.com/bramus/mixed-content-scan/graphs/contributors)

## About

`Mixed Content Scan` is a CLI Script which crawls+scans HTTPS-enabled websites for Mixed Content.

The script starts at a given URL, and then starts processing it:

*  All contained `img[src|srcset]`, `iframe[src]`, `script[src]`, `link[href][rel="stylesheet"]`, `object[data]`, `form[action]`, `embed[src]`, `video[src]`, `audio[src]`, `source[src|srcset]`, and `params[name="movie"][value]` elements are checked for being Mixed Content or not
*  All contained `a[href]` elements linking to the same or a deeper level are successively processed for Mixed Content.

## Installation

Installation is possible using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

```
composer global require bramus/mixed-content-scan:~2.6
```

_New to Composer?_ It's a command line tool for dependency management in PHP. On Linux/Unix/OSX you will need to [download and run the install script](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and _(recommended)_ successively [move `composer.phar` to a global location](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally). On Windows you will need to [run the installer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows)

## Usage

Run this script from the CLI, a such:

```
$ mixed-content-scan https://www.bram.us/
```

The script itself will start scanning and give feedback whilst running. When Mixed Content is found, the URLs causing Mixed Content warnings will be shown on screen:

```
$ mixed-content-scan https://www.bram.us/

Mixed Content Scan uses ANSI coloring, provided by [bramus/ansi-php](https://github.com/bramus/ansi-php), so one can easily spot errors based on the color.

## Advanced usage / CLI Options

Mixed Content Scan support several CLI options which can manipulate its behavior:

- `--output=path/to/file`: File to output results to. Defaults to `php://stdout` (= show on screen).
- `--format=ansi|no-ansi|json`: Define which formatter to use for outputting the results
    - `ansi` _(Default)_: ANSI Colored Line Formatter
    - `no-ansi`: Monolog Line Formatter
    - `json`: Monolog JSON Formatter
- `--no-crawl`: Don't crawl scanned pages for new pages
- `--no-check-certificate`: Don\'t check the certificate for validity (e.g. allow self-signed or missing certificates)
- `--timeout=value-in-milliseconds`: How long to wait for each request to complete. Defaults to 10000ms.
- `--input=path/to/file`: Specify a file containing a list of links as the source, instead of parsing the passed in URL. Automatically enables `--no-crawl`
- `--ignore=path/to/file`: File containing URL patterns to ignore. See _Ignoring links_ further down on how to build this file.
- `--loglevel=level`: The Monolog loglevel to log at. Defaults to `200`. See [Monolog Log Levels](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/24ad4b02b61f9b4484ca1c27ed3be4f9825ce7a5/doc/01-usage.md#log-levels) for more info.

Example: `mixed-content-scan https://www.bram.us/ --ignore=./wordpress.txt --output=./results.txt --format=no-ansi`

## Handling errors

Internally Mixed Content Scan uses Curl to perform requests. If an error should be encountered (in case of a connection loss for example), the error will be shown on screen:

```
...
[2015-01-07 12:56:43] MCS.INFO: 00003 - https://www.bram.us/projects/bramusicq/ [] []
[2015-01-07 12:56:53] MCS.CRITICAL: cURL Error (28): SSL connection timeout [] []
...
```

## Ignoring links

It's possible to define a list of patterns to ignore. To do so, create a text file with on each line a PCRE pattern to ignore. Pass in the path to that file using the `--ignore` option. Lines starting with `#` are considered being comments and therefore are ignored.

For a WordPress installation, the ignore pattern file – which is distributed with Mixed Content Scan in `ignorepattens/wordpress.txt` – would be this:

```
# Paginated Overview Links
^{$rootUrl}/page/(\d+)/$

# Single Post Links
# ^{$rootUrl}/(\d+)/(\d+)/

# Tag Overview Links
^{$rootUrl}/tag/

# Author Overview Links
^{$rootUrl}/author/

# Category Overview Links
^{$rootUrl}/category/

# Monthly Overview Links
^{$rootUrl}/(\d+)/(\d+)/$

# Year Overview Links
^{$rootUrl}/(\d+)/$

# Comment Subscription Link
^{$rootUrl}/comment-subscriptions

# Wordpress Core File Links
^{$rootUrl}/(.*)?wp\-(.*)\.php

# Archive Links
^{$rootUrl}/archive/

# Replyto Links
\?replytocom\=
```

The `{$rootUrl}` token in each pattern will be replaced with the (root) URL passed into the script.

Note: The [PHP PCRE Cheat Sheet](https://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/190m/12sp/cheat-sheets/php-regex-cheat-sheet.pdf) might come in handy.

## Known issues

Mixed Content Scan:

* Doesn't take `<base href="...">` into account _(but who uses that, anyways?)_
* Doesn't scan linked `.css` or `.js` files themselves for Mixed Content
* Doesn't scan inline `<script>` or `<style>` for mixed content

Please open an issue _(or fix it and perform a pull request ;))_ when you've encountered a problem.
